# The Shoe Store  
  
This project will consist of five screens. You don't have to create a shoe store, you can use any other item as long as you create the following screens. You will be creating:  
  
1. Login screen: Email and password fields and labels plus create and login buttons  
2. Welcome onboarding screen  
3. Instructions onboarding screen  
4. Shoe Listing screen  
5. Shoe Detail screen for adding a new shoe  
  
## Helps and attributes  
  
The mediums that I took help were from stackoverflow(for the error doubt checkings), @GavinF for the support and how exactly the project is supposed to be(like how it is supposed to look and work not the code), the mentor who answered the queries for me, the android docs and also especialy yasser I saw how he was doing the data saving and although I implemented mine in a similar way but I feel a bit more efficient that his way but truthfully without that hint I would never have gotten the answer for the ViewModel data saving hope you like my project :)
